# Simple Tic-Tac-Toe 2x2 in Unity
 A simple 2x2 tic-tac-toe example in Unity

 ## Usage
 This example is intended as an introduction to a project for a class of students. It is typically paired with a lecture explaining the implementation and decisions made around the code.
 
 The intention is to set students up to take this project and expand upon it to create a 3x3 tic-tac-toe game with art, a scoreboard for the two players, and a reset function every time someone wins.

 ## Implementation Notes
 * **This is a simple introductory project.** It's as much about teaching students how to work with sprite objects, conceptualize a game manager object, and handling a simple two player concept.
 * In the case of the _if_ statement, Occam's Razor is applied for simplicities sake. Sometimes the time to write the "slick" function is best spent elsewhere.
